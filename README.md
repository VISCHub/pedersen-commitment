Pedersen Commitments
====================

Commitment schemes are a way for one counterparty to commit to a value such that
the value committed remains private, but can be revealed at a later time when
the committing party divulges a necessary parameter of the commitment process.
Strong commitment schemes must be both information *hiding* and computationally
*binding*.
